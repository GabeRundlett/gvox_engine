## THIS BRANCH OF THE CODEBASE WAS/IS BROKEN AND NO LONGER MAINTAINED

I ran into an issue that started causing DXC to generate SPIR-V code that ultimately caused the driver to crash when processing it.
Recently (Jan 27, 2023) I re-built this codebase and found that DXC is now failing on the suspected broken code.
Search for DISABLE_DRIVER_BREAKING_CODE in the shaders if you want to investigate further...
